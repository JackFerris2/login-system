System Functionality and Session Timeout

This PHP login system allows a user to log in with a valid username and password stored
in a MySQL database. If the login is successful, they are taken to a secure admin page.
If login fails, they are redirected to an error page. A logout option is provided from
the admin page.

The system uses PHP sessions to manage login state. When the user logs in, a session is
created and a timestamp is stored. If the user stays on the admin page without activity
for more than 60 seconds, the session expires automatically. When this happens, the user
is redirected back to the login page, and the admin page is no longer accessible until they
log in again.
