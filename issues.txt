Known Issues and Assumptions

1. Known Issues:
- None currently. All features are working as expected.
- The system has not been tested with multiple users at the same time,
but it works for single-user access.

2. Assumptions:
- The username and password are hard-coded into the database
and are not meant to be edited through the interface.
- Only one user is added for this assignment (admin).
- It is assumed that the user knows the correct credentials to log in.
- PHP sessions are assumed to expire after 1 minute of inactivity.
